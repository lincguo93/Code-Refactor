# hw1 Horiseon HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor
Horiseon is home work 1 for refactor the existing code into a more meaningful one without changing the output.
After refactoring only the html code, I was having trouble to have the webpag performing the same actions like before so I discussed them with a tutor to try to fix it.
Because this practice was clear to only update the syntax in the html document and limited time to work on this assignment, I didn't comment the changes I added. However, it is really important in the future that I do record the changes in comments.
